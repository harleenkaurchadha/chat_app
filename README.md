service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
  
  match /users/{uid} {
    allow write: if request.auth!= null && request.auth.uid == uid;
  } 
  
  match /users/{uid} {
    allow read: if request.auth!= null;
  }
  
  match /chat/{document=**} {
    allow read, create: if request.auth!= null;
